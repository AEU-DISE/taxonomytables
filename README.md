# taxonomytables
Taxonomy tables from all our data types

## Drift and Ichthyoplankton 
These tables come from what was submitted to EcoAnalysts. 

## Zooplankton
This table comes from what was most recently published to EDI

## Fish
This table comes from what was most recently published to EDI. There are other fish species in our database, but these are the ones that have been caught in the data publication. 

## Parent_taxa_4
This was for Kisters. Includes all taxa in the census, and I used this to help modify some of our taxonomy tables. I still reference every now and then when checking taxa. It's a bit unwiedly but each taxon has a tab.
